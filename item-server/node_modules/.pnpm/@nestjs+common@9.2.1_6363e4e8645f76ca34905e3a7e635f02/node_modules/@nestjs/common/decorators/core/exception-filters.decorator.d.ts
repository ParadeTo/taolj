/**
 * Decorator that binds exception filters to the scope of the controller or
 * method, depending on its context.
 *
 * When `@UseFilters` is used at the controller level, the filter will be
 * applied to every handler (method) in the controller.
 *
 * When `@UseFilters` is used at the individual handler level, the filter
 * will apply only to that specific method.
 *
 * @param filters exception filter instance or class, or a list of exception
 * filter instances or classes.
 *
 * @see [Exception filters](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Exception filters can also be set up globally for all controllers and routes
 * using `app.useGlobalFilters()`.  [See here for details](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#binding-filters)
